# Introduction to Programming in Java

The focus on this module is primarily introducing *what programs are* more than actually writing programs. But, it wouldn't be fun to completely skip code in this module, so we will introduce some relatively simple programs.

I strongly recommend you clone this GitHub repository and regularly update it.  [This video](https://youtu.be/1inyTtkqRbw) (3:29) walks through doing that specifically for this course.  

## Introduction Videos

[The Parts of a Java Program](https://youtu.be/R_CA3St31ng) (1:56) goes over the boilerplate code that you'll see in almost every Java program.  Note that right now you are not expected to understand it all, but as you become more familiar with Java you will learn more about these features.

## EmptyClass.java

This program is the *simplest* Java program you can have - it is a valid program, but it literally does nothing. However, while it is the "simplest" program, there is still quite a bit going on, most of which we covered in The Parts of a Java Program video above.  

## HelloWorld.java

[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/T5WdWfnWbW4) (2:12) goes over how to write a simple Java program to print a message to the console

## ScannerInput.java 

[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/TwDUcFFfY70) (5:08) Using the scanner class to read integers & strings from the user.  Also a brief introduction to finding & fixing errors & warnings in Eclipse and how to use nextLine() to clear the user input buffer.

## PrintPrintln.java

[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/ed4SsdXFWdM) (4:38) This program goes over the differences between `System.out.print` and `System.out.println`
