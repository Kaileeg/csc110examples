MoreScanner.java [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/3Chk4qfVBTw) (6:52) goes over the Scanner classes next, nextInt, nextDouble, and nextLine methods and touches on some common mistakes students make.

## Strings

- StringExamples.java has some examples of working with `String` objects & string literals and comparing strings
- MoreStringExamples.java has additional examples of `String` functions available in Java.
- StringConcatenation.java [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/Aq5P5ylKwbA) (4:24): We can combine strings in Java using the string concatenation operator `+`.  We can also combine strings with the values of variables to print them out.

### MathAndRandom.java

 Examples of methods in the java.lang.Math & java.util.Random classes (**Note**: The purpose of this example is to demonstrate what is available - you don't necessarily need to understand all the math.)
