# Introduction to Programming

The focus on this module is primarily introducing *what programs are* more than actually writing programs. But, it wouldn't be fun to completely skip code in this module, so we will introduce some relatively simple programs.

## EmptyClass.java

This program is the *simplest* Java program you can have - it is a valid program, but it literally does nothing. However, while it is the "simplest" program, there is still quite a bit going on, which we will discuss in the video. Some of what we talk about will not make any sense to you yet, and that's ok - you will pick up more and more as you gain experience.

## HelloWorld.java
