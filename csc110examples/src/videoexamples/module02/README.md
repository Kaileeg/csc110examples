# Data and Expressions

This module will cover primitive types, strings, expressions, and using the Scanner class

## Printing To the Console

### PrintPrintln.java

This program goes over the differences between `System.out.print` and `System.out.println`

### EscapeSequences.java

EscapeSequences let us add non-printable characters such as the tab and newline characters to our strings.  We can also add characters normally not allowed in a string, such as quotes and backslashes.

## Strings

### StringConcatenation.java

We can combine strings in Java using the string concatenation operator `+`

## Variables

### PrimitiveVariables.java

This program goes over declaring & initializing the 8 different primitive types available in Java.

### Constants.java

Constants can be declared with `final` and are not allowed to be changed

## Helpful Classes

### MathAndRandom.java 

 Examples of methods in the java.lang.Math & java.util.Random classes (**Note**: The purpose of this example is to demonstrate what is available - you don't necessarily need to understand all the math.)
