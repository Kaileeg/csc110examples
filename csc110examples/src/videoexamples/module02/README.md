# Data and Expressions

This module will cover primitive types, strings, expressions, and using the Scanner class

## Printing To the Console

### PrintPrintln.java

This program goes over the differences between `System.out.print` and `System.out.println`

### EscapeSequences.java

EscapeSequences let us add non-printable characters such as the tab and newline characters to our strings.  We can also add characters normally not allowed in a string, such as quotes and backslashes.

## Strings

### StringConcatenation.java

We can combine strings in Java using the string concatenation operator `+`

## Variables

### PrimitiveVariables.java

This program goes over declaring & initializing the 8 different primitive types available in Java.
